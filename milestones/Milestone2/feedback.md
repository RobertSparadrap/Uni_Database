# M2 Feedback 

## Checkpoint #1

• I couldn't find your table describing ON DELETE ON UPDATE motivations in your document (-1 point)

• Your forwarding enginnering file thrown the following error when I tried to run it: "Error Code: 3780. Referencing column 'Researcher_researcher_id' and referenced column 'researcher_id' in foreign key constraint 'fk_Researcher_has_PaperResearch_Researcher1' are incompatible." (-1 point)

I know you have done a lot of work in this milestone, and you were really active asking questions about the milestone but you are missing one of the components in m2.pdf and your forward engineering file is throwing errors.


## M2 Grade: 23/25
